# Sticks-Game

The user can play the game by reading the instructions and typing in the console.

The user can choose to play with another user, a simple AI, or a self-trained AI.

The user fist chooses the number of sticks to be placed on the table (within 10 to 100).

Then, the two players take turn to pick some sticks away from the table.

Each user can pick from 1 to 3 sticks.

The game ends when there is no stick left on the table.

The player who has picked the last stick on the table wins.
